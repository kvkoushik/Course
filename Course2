Pawan Dubey
Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Koushik
Divide and Conquer Algorithms
Time complexity and how implementation of algorithms impact time and space complexity. When working on a huge dataset the order of time that impacts is very astonishing. Just a tweak in the process has so much impact on the time taken.
